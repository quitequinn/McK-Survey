						<h3>About Future Economy Minnesota</h1>
						<p>Clean Energy Economy Minnesota showcases how Clean Energy is lessening Minnesota's reliance on imported fossil fuels while growing local jobs, driving innovation, keeping pollution out of Minnesota's lakes and air, and building prosperity in our state.</p>
						<p>This site also reveals the link between the state’s clean energy policies and industry growth. Employment in clean energy firms is growing more rapidly than employment in the state overall and these are high-quality jobs with wages well above the state average.</p>
						<p>The figures and statistics used to create Clean Energy Economy Minnesota came from Minnesota’s Clean Energy Economy Profile report, the state’s most comprehensive effort to quantify the businesses, employment, wages, and investments directly engaged in the clean energy economy.</p>
						<p>This research is part of the Minnesota National Governors Association (NGA) Policy Academy’s effort to align economic development and clean energy strategies.</p>
						<p class="space-bottom-large">More information about the NGA project and its findings can be found at www.mn.gov/deed/clean.</p>
