						<p>Total wages were up 79 percent from $600 million in 2000 across all five CleanEnergy sectors (energy efficiency, wind power, solar energy, bioenergy, and smart grid). These are good jobs making Minnesota’s economy more productive and competitive while delivering energy that is secure, clean, and affordable. Jobs range from manufacturing, sales, and distribution to installation, maintenance, and research.</p>

						<p>Minnesota was the first state to require the use of ethanol in our fuel supply and ranks 4thin the US for ethanol production capacity. The state also has the most E85 stations in the country.</p>
						<p>In 2013, the Solar Energy Standard was passed requiring investor-owned utilities to have 1.5% of electric sales from solar by 2020. The state also required the development of a program for community solar projects as well as created the nation’s first Value of Solar tariff as an alternative to net metering.</p>

						<h6 class="no-space-top margin-bottom-large">President, <a href="http://www.trunorthsolar.com/">TruNorth</a>, Solar Energy</h6>
						<p>In 2009, Martin’s father asked him and a few friends to build a solar array for their farm in Bemidji. He never imagined it would take him down the path to own and operate a sustainable solar business, TruNorth Solar,  which he built with genuine passion for environmental stewardship. TruNorth Solar operates two divisions: one focused on Residential/Small Commercial Solar and the other on Commercial/Industrial/Community Solar. Solar installation is not easy.” says Martin. “It’s extremely physical and combines many different trades and skills to install a quality solar pv system. TruNorth Solar’s culture is founded on our addiction to a hard day’s work and we pride ourselves in flipping the switch at the completion of each project.”</p>
						<p>Solar energy is helping Minnesota to become more energy independent and rely less on outside sources for its energy needs. Martin’s favorite part of his work is teaching others about solar energy and sustainability. “It’s fun, exciting and easy to understand if explained clearly.” Much of Martin’s time is spent working with TruNorth Solar’s team members to keep each of the business engines running. He still looks forward to days spent in the field.</p>

						<p>Steve Evans is a Senior Operations Technician at Iberdrola Renewables’ Elm Creek II Wind Farm in Alpha, Minnesota. The wind farmer where Steve works is the third project Iberdrola has developed in partnership with a landowner group and includes 62 turbines. Steve started as a warranty technician on the GE wind turbines at the Trimont Wind Farm and later moved to work on the Mitsubishi wind turbines at Elm Creek II, which makes enough electricity to power 40,000 homes in a year.</p>
						<p>Iberdrola Renewables is the second-largest wind operator in the U.S. and is one of the few companies able to provide Clean Energy solutions that allow large industrial and commercial customers to manage risks and uncertainty in the natural gas and power industries. Steve is happy to work at Iberdrola Renewables because he’s able to put his skills to good use on homeground. He enjoys working in the Clean Energy field because he continues to learn a lot. One day, he hopes to manage his own wind farm.</p>
